fred is curious about the state of agriculture in Kenya. He is interested to know what kinds of livestock is raised there, where they are, and how their numbers compare to each other. Where the most of each category are.

--query and larger markers per number (similar to energy facilities)
    --total same format larger markers, color coded by top category
        --distirict 1 top categ is cattle so green
        --district 2 top categ is camel so blue
        
very similar to energy map plus sort and query element

popup could have district name, county name, province? top 3 animal categories and numbers
